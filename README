GRAUDIT

Graudit is a simple script and signature sets that allows you to find potential 
security flaws in source code using the GNU utility grep. It's comparable to 
other static analysis applications like RATS, SWAAT and flaw-finder while keeping 
the technical requirements to a minimum and being very flexible.

USAGE
Graudit supports several options and tries to follow good shell practices. For
a list of the options you can run graudit -h or see below. The simplest way to use 
graudit is;
graudit /path/to/scan
