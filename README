GRAUDIT

Graudit is a simple script and signature sets that allows you to find potential 
security flaws in source code using the GNU utility grep. It's comparable to 
other static analysis aplications like RATS and flawfinder while keeping the 
technical requirements to a minimum and being very flexible.
