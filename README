GRAUDIT

Graudit is a simple script and signature sets that allows you to find potential 
security flaws in source code using the GNU utility grep. It's comparable to 
other static analysis applications like RATS, SWAAT and flaw-finder while 
keeping the technical requirements to a minimum and being very flexible.

USAGE
Graudit supports several options and tries to follow good shell practices. For
a list of the options you can run graudit -h or see below. The simplest way to 
use graudit is;
graudit <options> /path/to/scan

The following options are available:
  -h prints a short help text
  -v prints version number
  -d <db> database to use
  -c <num> number of lines of context to display, default is 2
  -z supress colors


DATABASES
Graudit uses extended regular expressions (POSIX) as it's signatures and comes 
with several databases ready for use. You can extend the existing databases or 
make your own if you require additional signatures.

* Default is aimed at finding low hanging fruit. It cointains generic rules that 
should match common vulnerabilites in several languages. However, in order to 
find additional vulnerabilities for a specific language you should use the 
language specific databases.

CONTRIBUTING
